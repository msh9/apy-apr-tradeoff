# Repository Guidelines

## Tools and overall approach
The library is to be written as both a small reusable module exposing math functions for comparison calculations and as a web component that can be directly integrated into a page.

The web component should be built with `lit` tooling, include reasonable light/dark builtin styling and expose handles for a user to provide a CSS for styling.

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/` contains source code for the project
- `tests/` mirrors `src/` folder names so every helper or component ships with a matching spec (e.g., `src/state/loan-math.js` ↔ `tests/state/loan-math.test.js`).
- `docs/` and the `README.md` file host user-facing notes (eg `docs/loan-scenarios.md`) 

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install` — install dependencies; rerun whenever package manifests change.
- `npm run dev` — start the lightweight Vite server for hot-reload verification of Alpine components.
- `npm run build` — emit the minified bundle into `dist/` for deployment; fails if type errors or ESLint issues persist.
- `npm run test` — execute unit tests via Vitest; prefer `npm run test -- --runInBand` before commits touching loan math.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Use ES modules, 2-space indentation, and single quotes for strings unless template literals add clarity.
- Alpine component IDs follow `loan-*` kebab-case (e.g., `loan-summary-card`).
- Pure helpers live in `loan-math.js` with named exports; DOM-manipulating files end with `.ui.js` to signal side effects.
- Run `npm run lint` (ESLint + Prettier) before opening a pull request; config enforces no implicit globals and browser-safe APIs only.
- As needed and when appropriate write javascript appropriate for accurately handling monetary amounts. This means full precision calculations, rounding only when displaying final results. It also means avoiding floating point math where possible.

## Testing Guidelines
- Write Vitest specs for every branch of amortization logic, mocking only built-in APIs like `Intl.NumberFormat` when necessary.
- Snapshot HTML for key Alpine templates using `@testing-library/alpine` helpers living under `tests/ui/`.
- Target ≥90% statement coverage on `loan-math` modules; document any exclusions inside `tests/coverage-exemptions.md`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Follow Conventional Commits (`feat: add adjustable-rate inputs`, `fix: correct APR rounding`), keeping scope names such as `loan-math` or `ui` for quick filtering.
- Each PR must describe the scenario, affected loan formulas, manual test steps (`npm run dev`, scenario values), and include screenshots or GIFs when UI shifts.
- Link related issues in the PR body (`Closes #12`) and reference ADR updates when altering assumptions about rates or repayment cadence.

## Documentation & Support
- Update `README.md` whenever inputs/outputs change, and extend `docs/loan-scenarios.md` with example borrower profiles whenever you add a new calculator path.
- Record sensitive configuration (e.g., API keys for rate tables) in `.env.example`, never in committed code; document expected units (percent vs decimal) inline.
